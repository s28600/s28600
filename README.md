## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Illya Moskalenko and I'm a 3rd year student of computer science, this profile displays my projects and personal implementations of concepts presented at university.  
Repos in my profile:
+ ML_Algortihms_and_Structures - personal implementations of machine learning algorithms and structures such as kNN, k-means, naive bayes algorithms and structures like perceptron or single layer neural network using perceprtons
+ REST_and_DB_Applications - REST APIs using .NET framework
+ Physics_Simulation - using applied mathematics to calculate physics like trajectory of a falling or rolling object, pendulum, string, earth cycle around sun, heatmap and so on using methods including Euler, Midpoint and RK4
